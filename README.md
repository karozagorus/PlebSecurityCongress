# PlebSecCongress

There comes a time in one's life when we must stop and think, to examine our situation within the world in order to see the road ahead. 2020 has so far posed unprecedented turbulence for many; with government overreach of power and the endless printing of money accelerating, more upheaval is expected to come.<br>
As we move forward, it becomes more and more apparent that the gaze of those in power will focus onto Bitcoin and its users. While some avenues to attack Bitcoin are slowly closing in, new forms of attack emerge that target the social layer of the Bitcoin ecosystem.<br>
<br>
Individuals are simply not prepared.<br>
<br>
The plans of 'Big Government' to control Bitcoin will be executed on an asymmetric battlefront. Around the world, they will attempt to encircle and then eliminte the ability of the sovereign individual to regain their freedom through the use of bitcoin. National banks will offer custodial storage solutions that exercise control by capturing a large percentage of its supply. The next logical step is to restrict the movement of bitcoin within the privacy-invasive KYC/ AML policies of exchanges and banks, preventing users from withdrawing their funds into individual custody.<br>
<br>
The ultimate goal of those in power is to render our ability to organize, impossible. They might achieve this, but only if we let them.<br>
<br>
This security congress was created to help bitcoiners get informed, get educated, debate these issues, and receive valuable input from knowledgeable individuals among them.<br>
It is important that we start addressing them now, not later.<br>
